Project Description: 

I created an NFL game generator app that uses a webscraping algorithm to pick any NFL game in the history of the NFL. The user will begin by selecting a team, week, and year and the app will show the corresponding game. Along with this, the app will show all of the players that played in the game from both teams. There are two webscraping algorithms that incorporate the "BeautifulSoup4 (BS4)" Module, tkinter, and requests.

To Install and Run the App: 

  -Install BeautifulSoup4 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/beautifulsoup-installation-python/
  
  -Install tkinter https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python
  
  -Install lxml https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-install-lxml-in-python/
  
  -Install requests https://www.agiratech.com/install-requests-library-in-python
  
  -Use the file "matchGeneratorMain.py" 
  
  NOTE: User must have requests, tkinter, lxml and BeautifulSoup4 installed from pip
