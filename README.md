Project Description: 

I created an NFL game generator app that uses a webscraping algorithm to pick any NFL game in the history of the NFL. The user will begin by selecting a team, week, and year and the app will show the corresponding game. Along with this, the app will show all of the players that played in the game from both teams. There are two webscraping algorithms that incorporate the "BeautifulSoup4 (BS4)" Module.

To Run the App: 
  -Use the file "matchGeneratorMain.py" 
  NOTE: User must have requests and BeautifulSoup4 installed from pip
